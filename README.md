# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning and LSTM

## Overview
This project aims to classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The dataset used contains various emails labeled as ham (not spam) or spam.

## Objectives
- Classify email text into spam or not spam.
- Utilize different machine learning models and LSTM networks for classification.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:
- `Category`: Label of the email (ham or spam).
- `Message`: The content of the email.

## Methods
### Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning and preprocessing the email text data using **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit).
- Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.

### Machine Learning Models
- Implementing various machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest for initial classification.

### LSTM Networks
- Building and training an LSTM network for improved classification performance.
- Using Keras and TensorFlow libraries for deep learning implementation.

## Results
The project evaluates the performance of different models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best approach for spam detection.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of both traditional machine learning models and LSTM networks for email spam detection, highlighting the advantages of deep learning in handling text classification tasks.
